# Categorization task

This is a categorization task currently developed to be an online version of the task used in the paper: 

Goldenberg, A., Sweeny, T., Shpigel, E., & Gross, J. (2018, August 26). Is this my group or not? The role of ensemble coding of emotional expressions in group categorization. https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/c28uh

In order to run the task you would need to add the face morphs (which require getting approval from the original creator). Please contact me to get those.
